[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) lets you connect apps together and move data around using automated workflows. Our Zapier integration has three **Actions** and five **Triggers** to help you move data between Dovetail and the other apps you use, in both directions.

## Actions

Actions help you get data **into** Dovetail from other apps. For example, using a Dovetail Action, you could create notes from SurveyMonkey responses, save Twitter mentions as notes, or create insights from new Jira issues.

Dovetail supports the following Zapier Actions:

| Trigger         | Description                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **New Note**    | Creates a new note in a Dovetail project.    |
| **New Tag**     | Creates a new tag in a Dovetail project.     |
| **New Insight** | Creates a new insight in a Dovetail project. |

## Triggers

Triggers help you get data **out of** Dovetail and into other apps. For example, using a Dovetail Trigger, you could backup highlights to Google Sheets, create new cards in Trello for new notes, or post new insights to a Slack room.

Dovetail supports the following Zapier Triggers:

| Trigger                            | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Note**                       | Triggers when a new note is created in a project.                       |
| **New Tag**                        | Triggers when a new tag is created in a project.                        |
| **New Insight**                    | Triggers when a new insight is created in a project.                    |
| **New Highlight With Any Tag**     | Triggers when a new highlight is created with any tag in a project.     |
| **New Highlight With Any Insight** | Triggers when a new highlight is created with any insight in a project. |
