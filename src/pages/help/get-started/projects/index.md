To get started with Dovetail, you’ll need to create a project. Projects contain groups of notes, tags, and insights, along with highlights and charts.

Teams, projects, groups, and notes / tags / insights exist in a hierarchy:

1.  Teams have many projects.
1.  Projects have many groups.
1.  Groups have many notes, tags, or insights.

## Projects

In Dovetail, projects can represent many things. For example, a project could contain:

- A set of customer interviews.
- A set of user testing sessions.
- A collection of ongoing user feedback.
- A collection of feedback from other apps.
- A large research project covering many methods.

**Note:** Tags are project-specific. Create a new project when you want to create a new set of tags, or continue using the same project if you’d like to share tags.

Projects have tabs to switch between notes, tags, insights, and charts. Each tab (except charts) contains groups for you to organize your content.

You can view groups as a **list** or a **board** by switching near the top right of the screen, and rearrange groups with drag and drop.
