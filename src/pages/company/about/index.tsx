                        We started Dovetail because we believe that deeply understanding one’s customers is the secret
                        ingredient to making great products. Therefore our mission is to help teams collect, organize, analyze,
                        and collaborate on user research data.

                        Dovetail has been growing steadily since our initial launch. We now have hundreds of researchers,
                        designers, and product managers using Dovetail worldwide at great organizations like Atlassian, CSIRO,
                        Deloitte, Elsevier, Freshworks, HotelsCombined, Nike, Uniqa, and more.

                    our customers. We believe in simple and transparent pricing. Our price is always available on our website,
                    and we charge a simple flat monthly fee regardless of organization size.

                    period. We respect Do Not Track on our website. And we make mistakes, but when we do, we own up to them
                    honestly and try to make amends.

                    marketing or sales. We prefer building intuitive experiences over documentation and tutorials. We prefer
                    building a great set of features that “sell themselves” over hiring a sales team. When we do work on things
                    that aren’t the product (for example, this website), we hold ourselves to a high standard.
